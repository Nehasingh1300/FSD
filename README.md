## How does internet work?
[Paper](http://www.theshulers.com/whitepapers/internet_whitepaper/index.html)<br>
In Brief:<br>
You need to understand that there are some set of rules called as **protocols**, according to which things are done!<br>
Internet works on **Internet Protocol** and **Transport Control Protocol**<br>
<br>In Protocol Stack, we have 4 layers:<br>
**Application Protocol Layer<br>Transmission Control Protocol <br>Internet Protocol Layer<br>Hardware PRotocol<br>**<br><br>
The data will be broken into small **packets** if they are large as transferring large packets will be difficuilt.<br>
In **Application Protocol Layer**, it specifies the data according to the particular domain like www, email, FTP, etc.<br>
In **Transmission Layer Control Protocol**, specifies the computer to a particular computer according to its destination using **Port Number**.<br>
In **Internet Protocol Layer**, specifies the IP Address of the computer.<br>
In **Hardware Layer**, converts binary code to network signals and back.<br>
